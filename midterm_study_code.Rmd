Code from Ch. 1 - Multivariate Data Analysis


```{r}
library(MVA) 
demo("Ch-MVA")
```





#### Pearson Correlation and Covariance

Note: use = complete.obs argument will discard the entire row if an NA is present.

```{r}

# correlation matrix, rounded to 2 decimals 
data_cor <- round(cor(mtcars, use = "complete"), 2)
data_cor
```


```{r}
# cov matrix rounded to 2 decimals
data_cov <- round(cov(mtcars, use = "complete"), 2) 

```



#### for loop 

Simple for loop function in R. Below, the loop writes over the values in the first three columns with the respective column mean. 

```{r}


for (cols in c(1,2,3)) { 
  
  mtcars[, cols] <- mean(mtcars[, cols])
  
}

# inspect the first three columns where the values were overwritten 
head(mtcars) 
```
